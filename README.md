Works done during the digital image processing lecture in MS degree.

LAB01: Image negative, log transform, gamma correction, blur by image correlation, blur by averaging mask, impulse noise reduction by median filter.

LAB02: Histogram equalizing, sharpening image by scaling and non-scaling Laplacian using sharpening and high-boost masks, image smoothing by Gaussian blur.

LAB03: Histogram equalization in a low-contrast image, two-dimensional fast Fourier Transform of an image.

LAB04: Sobel operation on image processing, applying gamma transformation on the image, image analysis in the frequency domain by using the two-dimensional fast Fourier Transform.

LAB05: Applying the Sobel in two dimensions to detect the edges in the image, examining the Sobel edge detection on a smoothed image, global threshold, Otsu threshold technique, local threshold.

main: The project regarding detecting cigarette butts that are thrown to the ground to prevent environmental pollution.
